# Simple Photo Album

Port of my mod_perl album [Apache-Album](https://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Apache/Apache-Album-0.96.readme "Apache-Album")

## ABSTRACT
This is a simple photo album. Copy pngs/jpegs to a directory, create an optional text block (in a file called caption.txt) to go to the top, and the program does the rest.

Default settings are in config.yaml and may be overriden by using config.yaml files in directories with images.

## INSTALLATION

```
$ go get github.com/jddwoody/album
```
